# Monad

[Lecture](https://youtu.be/d9AW5kg2Vms?si=gGDzjOdhzJTIrpA3)

- Described as the building blocks of reality
	- Self-sufficient, indivisible, simple substance.
	- Self-sufficient because it depends on nothing for its existence. Monad is created directly by God, or to use Leibniz' words: the monad is fulgurated by God. 
		- To fulgurate is to create energy or light.
	- Thus, God creates monads, and continuously bestows existence on them.
	- The monad is also indivisible, which poses a problem.
		- Anything that is touchable, physical, material is divisible.
		- An apple, a biscuit, anything that has mass is divisible, even the smallest pieces of an apple or biscuit can be cut/sliced.
		- The only way for a monad to be indivisible is to be immaterial, not to have any physical existence. This is the only way the monad can fulfill the condition of indivisibility. The monad does not occupy any space, it is not material, or touchable, or physical.
		- Based on this, reality is not material/physical, because Leibniz says monads are the building blocks of reality. 
		
- So if monads are immaterial, reality is immaterial. It is impossible for something that is non-physical to comprise something physical. 
	- This means that all the physical things that we interact with do not exist.
	- This is an extreme idea, because in our daily lives we interact with many things that are touchable, material, physical. 

- So how can we explain the existence of these things?
- We have to look at the different types of Monads Leibniz lists
- There are four types, 3 + 1 Supreme Monad because Leibniz refers to God as the 'Supreme Monad':
	- Basic Monads 
	- Soul Monads
	- Spirit Monads
	- The Supreme Monad
- Supreme Monad:
	- God, only one Supreme Monad
	- Has absolute Apperception 
- Spirit Monads
	- Humans!
	- Conscious
	- Can reason
	- Can have plans for the future
	- Have cognitive abilities 
- Soul Monads 
	- Animals
	- Have consciousness 
	- Have memory
		- Leibniz' example: a dog who has been beaten with a baton. Every time the dog sees a baton he flees and tries to escape, because he has this memory of being beaten by a baton.
- Basic Monads
	- Barely conscious
	- Low form of consciousness, such as plants. 

- Situation involving hierarchical levels of monads at play:
	- You are at home sitting on a sofa watching a TV and playing with your dog.
	- In this situation there is no room, there is no sofa, there is no television and you are not interacting with your dog, because according to Leibniz monads are windowless. It's impossible for any monad to affect another.
	- What really exists in this situation is a spirit monad: you and a soul monad: the dog. 
	- There is no interaction between you and the dog. It is God that simulates an interaction between the two of you, an interaction that you THINK you are having with your dog. 
	- This can be extrapolated to the whole world, and say in the world there are no physical objects, there is no space because what is space but distances that exist between physical objects? If there are are no physical objects then there is no space. 
	- All there is is an infinite number of monads and God that generates and simulates conversations and situations in which these monads appear to interact.

- Why does Leibniz subscribe to this view?
	- You can argue that if you believe physical objects exist, there is a number of questions that go unanswered, most importantly: where does consciousness reside?
	- Most meticulous scrutiny of the human body still cannot locate where consciousness is. 
	- Also mental properties that are real, but cannot be explained away through bodily processes. 

- Leibniz argues that when you adopt his idea of monads you solve the problems of consciousness and mental properties.
